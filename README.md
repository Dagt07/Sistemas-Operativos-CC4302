# Sistemas-Operativos-CC4302

## Course Overview

The goal of the operating systems course is to teach students how to develop programs that effectively utilize multi-core processors. Additionally, students will learn to assess how the operating system's core strategies for managing hardware resources—such as CPUs, primary memory, and disks/SSDs—affect the performance of applications.

## Platform Requirements

The official platform for testing assignments is Debian 12, which should be run under VirtualBox. It is also acceptable to use Debian 11 under WSL 2, VMware Player, or QEmu for the course exercises.
